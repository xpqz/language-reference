This applies to AIX only.

Under UNIX, when a child process terminates, it signals to its parent that it has terminated and waits for the parent to acknowledge that signal. `4002⌶` is the mechanism to allow the APL programmer to issue such acknowledgements.

`Y` must be a simple empty vector but is ignored.

The result `R` is a matrix containing the list of the newly-terminated processes which have been terminated as a result of receiving the acknowledgement, along with information about each of those processes as described below.

`R[;1]` is the process ID (PID) of the terminated child

`R[;2]` is `¯1` if the child process terminated normally, otherwise it is the signal number which caused the child process to terminate.

`R[;3]` is `¯1` if the child process terminated as the result of a signal, otherwise it is the exit code of the child process

The remaining 15 columns are the contents of the `rusage` structure returned by the underlying `wait3()` system call. Note that the two timevalstructs are each returned as a floating point number.

The current `rusage` structure contains:
struct rusage {    struct timeval ru_utime; /* user time used */    struct timeval ru_stime; /* system time used */    long   ru_maxrss;        /* maximum resident set size */    long   ru_ixrss;         /* integral shared memory size */    long   ru_idrss;         /* integral unshared data size */    long   ru_isrss;         /* integral unshared stack size */    long   ru_minflt;        /* page reclaims */    long   ru_majflt;        /* page faults */    long   ru_nswap;         /* swaps */    long   ru_inblock;       /* block input operations */    long   ru_oublock;       /* block output operations */    long   ru_msgsnd;        /* messages sent */    long   ru_msgrcv;        /* messages received */    long   ru_nsignals;      /* signals received */    long   ru_nvcsw;         /* voluntary context switches */    long   ru_nivcsw;        /* involuntary context switches */};

`4002⌶` may return the PID of an abnormally terminated Auxiliary Processor; APL code should check that the list of processes that have been reaped is a superset of the list of processes that have been started.
