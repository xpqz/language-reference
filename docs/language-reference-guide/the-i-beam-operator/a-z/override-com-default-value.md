Certain COM objects, for example, VT_BLOBs, cannot be represented in APL or may be in error. By default Dyalog will generate a `DOMAIN ERROR` in these cases. For COM objects of type VT_EMPTY the interpreter by default returns `⎕NULL`.

`2041⌶` allows the APL programmer to specify what is returned by the interpreter in these cases.

`Y` may be `1` or `2`.

If `Y` is `1`, then `X` specifies the value that is returned instead of `⎕NULL` when the COM object is of type VT_EMPTY.

If `Y` is `2`, then `X` specifies the value that is returned when the COM object is in error, or is of a type that cannot be represented in APL.

In both cases, omitting `X` results in the default behaviour being restored.

`R` is the previous value specified; if there was no previous value then this function will perform its task but generate a `VALUE ERROR`.
