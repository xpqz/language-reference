This function generates an array of random numbers from a named probability distribution.  Note that this is not currently implemented for AIX and macOS.

`Y` is a 2-item vector containing the name of the probability distribution from those listed in the table below, and the shape of the result.

`X` is a scalar or 1 or 2 element numeric vector that specifies parameters.

For example to get an array with shape (3 5 7) of uniform random numbers for the interval from ¯17.3 to 12.7, you’d enter
```apl
      ¯17.3 12.7 (16808 ⌶) 'Uniform' (3 5 7)
```

If you wanted a vector of 100,000 uniform random numbers for that interval, you’d enter
```apl
      ¯17.3 12.7 (16808 ⌶) 'Uniform' 100000
```

The domain rules for the distributions currently  implemented are as follows:

| Distribution | X[1] | X[2] | Domain Rules |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `'Uniform'` | a | b | a < b ; A numeric interval. Example: 1.0 7.6 |
| `'Beta'` | a | b | a > 0  AND b > 0 |
| `'Bernoulli'` | probability |  | probability ≥ 0 AND probability ≤ 1 |
| `'Binomial'` | trials | probability | trials is an integer ≥ 0;  probability ≥ 0 AND probability ≤ 1 |
| `'Cauchy'` | location | scale | location unrestricted; scale > 0 |
| `'Chi Squared'` | degree of freedom |  | degree of freedom ≥ 0 |
| `'Exponential'` | rate |  | rate  ≥ 0 |
| `'F'` | a | b | a ≥  eps AND b ≥ eps; where eps is smallest non-zero positive float number |
| `'Gamma'` | a | b | a ≥ 0 AND b ≥eps; where eps is smallest non-zero positive float number |
| `'Inverse Gamma'` | a | b | a ≥ 0 AND b ≥ 0 |
| `'Laplace'` | location | scale | location unrestricted; scale ≥ 0 |
| `'Logistic'` | location | scale | location unrestricted; scale ≥ 0 |
| `'Log Normal'` | location | scale | location unrestricted; scale ≥ 0 |
| `'Normal'` | location | scale | location unrestricted; scale ≥ 0 |
| `'Poisson'` | rate |  | rate ≥ 0 |
| `'Student T'` | degree of freedom |  | degree of freedom ≥eps where eps is smallest non-zero positive float number |
| `'Weibull'` | a | b | a ≥  eps AND b ≥ eps ; eps is smallest non-zero positive float number |

Each of those distributions has a corresponding Wikipedia entry with a description of its theoretical foundation and usually graphs of the probability density functions and cumulative distribution functions for interesting sets of parameter values.

# Example

The probability density function for the Beta distribution (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution](https//enwikipediaorg/wiki/beta_distribution#)) with the parameter vector (2 5) has an interesting shape.

`BucketCount` counts random numbers that fall into a sequence of evenly distributed bucket intervals:
```apl

      BucketCounts←{
[1]        ir←⌊⍵÷÷⍺
[2]        kir←{⍺(≢⍵)}⌸ir
[3]        kir[;⎕IO]÷←⍺
[4]        kir[⍋kir[;⎕IO];]
[5]    }

```

So then we can create 100,000 samples and calculate values for a density graph with 1,000 evenly spaced buckets by:
```apl

      rv←2 5 (16808⌶)'Beta' 100000
      bc←1000 BucketCounts rv
```

Using the Chart Wizard  we can plot `(⊂2)⌷⍉bc` against `(⊂1)⌷⍉bc` to get the graph:
