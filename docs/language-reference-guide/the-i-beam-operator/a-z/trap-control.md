This function is used to temporarily disable the error trapping mechanism used by `:Trap` and `⎕TRAP`. This can be useful in debugging applications.

`Y` is an integer 0, 1 or 2 as shown in the following table.

`R` is the previous value (0, 1, or 2) of the trap state.

| `Y` | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Enable all traps. |
| `1` | Disable all traps. |
| `2` | Disable traps in suspended functions from triggering when an error is generated in the Session. |

Note that the **Disable traps in session** option of the Session**Options** menu performs the same tasks as `(600⌶0)` and `(600⌶2)`.

For  error-guards in dfns `600⌶0` and `600⌶2` are equivalent; in neither case is an error generated in the session caught by an error guard in a suspended dfn.
