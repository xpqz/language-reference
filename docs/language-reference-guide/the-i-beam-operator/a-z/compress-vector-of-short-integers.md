In most cases this I-Beam functionality will be used in conjunction with `220⌶` (Serialise/Deserialise Array). However, it may be possible to pass the raw compressed data to and from other applications.

`X` specifies the operation to be performed, either compression or decompression, the compression library to be used, and any  optional parameters. `Y` contains the data to be operated on.

# Compression

`Y` must be a **sint_vector**.

`R` is a two item vector, each of which is a **sint_vector**. `R[1]` describes the compression, and `R[2]` contains the raw data which is the result of applying the compression library to the input data `Y`.

`X` is specified as follows:

| `X[1]` | `X[2]` | Compression Library |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | n/a | LZ4 |
| 2 | 0 .. 9 | zlib |
| 3 | 0 .. 9 | gzip |
| 4 | n/a | LZ4 with frames (compresses arrays >2GB) |

If LZ4 compression is required, then `X` must either be a scalar or a one element vector. Otherwise, `X[2]`, if present, specifies the compression level; higher numbers produce better compression, but take longer.

# Decompression

`R` is a **sint_vector**, containing the output of applying the decompression library to the input data, `Y`.

If `X` is a scalar or a one item vector, and has the value 0, then `Y` must be a vector of two items which is the result of previously calling `219⌶` to compress a **sint_vector**.

Otherwise, `X` is a scalar or one or two element vector and `Y` must be a **sint_vector**.

The first element of `X` must be one of the following values.

| `X[1]` | Compression Library |
| --- | --- |
| `¯1` | LZ4 |
| `¯2` | zlib |
| `¯3` | gzip |

The second, optional, element of `X` specifies the length of the uncompressed data. Its presence results in a more efficient use of the compression library.

`X` may not be a two item vector whose first item has the value 0.
