<div class="heading">
  <div class="name">Close .NET AppDomain</div>
  <div class="command">R←2101⌶Y</div>
</div>

This function closes the current .NET AppDomain.

`Y` may be any array and is ignored.

The result `R` is 0 if the operation succeeded or a non-zero integer if it failed.

This I-Beam is very likely to be changed in future.
