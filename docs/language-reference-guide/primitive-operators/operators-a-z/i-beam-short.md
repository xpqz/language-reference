I-Beam is a monadic operator that provides a range of system related services.

WARNING: Although documentation is provided for I-Beam functions, any service provided using I-Beam should be considered as "experimental" and subject to change – without notice - from one release to the next. Any use of I-Beams in applications should therefore be carefully isolated in cover-functions that can be adjusted if necessary.

`A` is an integer that specifies the type of operation to be performed. `Y` is an array that supplies further information about what is to be done.

`X` may or may not be required depending on `A`.

`R` is the result of the derived function.

For further information, see [I-Beam: on page 1](/primitive-operators/i-beam.md#I-Beam).
