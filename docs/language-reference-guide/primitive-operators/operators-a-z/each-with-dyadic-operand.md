`f` may be any dyadic function.  `X` and `Y` may be any arrays whose corresponding items (after scalar extension) are appropriate to function `f` when applied separately.

The derived function is applied separately to each pair of corresponding elements of `X` and `Y`.  If `X` or `Y` is a scalar or single-element array, it will be extended to conform with the other argument.  The derived function need not produce an explicit result.  If a result is returned, `R` has the same shape as `Y` (after possible scalar extension) whose elements are the items produced by the application of the derived function to the corresponding items of `X` and `Y`.

If `X` or `Y` is empty, the operand function is applied *once* between the prototypes of `X` and `Y` to determine the prototype of `R`.
