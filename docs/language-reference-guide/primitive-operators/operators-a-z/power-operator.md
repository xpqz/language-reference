If right operand `g` is a numeric integer scalar, power applies its left operand function `f` cumulatively `g` times to its argument. In particular, `g` may be Boolean 0 or 1 for conditional function application.

If right operand `g` is a scalar-returning dyadic *function*, then left operand function `f` is applied repeatedly until `((f Y) g Y)` or until a strong interrupt occurs. Notice that power calls its dyadic right operand `g` with the next `(f Y)` and current `(Y)` values of the iteration as left and right arguments. In particular, if `g` is `=` or `≡`, the result is sometimes termed a *fixpoint* of `f`.

If a left argument `X` is present, it is bound as left argument to left operand function `f`:
```apl
      X (f ⍣ g) Y → (X∘f ⍣ g) Y
```

A *negative* right operand `g` applies the *inverse* of the operand function `f`, `(|g)`times. In this case, `f` may be a primitive function or an expression of primitive functions combined with primitive operators:

| `∘` | compose |
| --- | --- |
| `¨` | each |
| `∘.` | outer product |
| `⍨` | commute |
| `\` | scan |
| `[]` | axis |
| `⍣` | power |

If the function does not have an inverse, a negative argument `g` generates `DOMAIN ERROR`.

# Warning

Some expressions, such as the following, will cause an infinite internal loop and APL will appear to hang. In most cases this can be resolved by issuing a hard INTERRUPT.
```apl
      !⍣-1
      !⍣-2
```

One can ensure that weak interrupts and `⎕TKILL` can interrupt by packaging the `⍣` within the dop      `{⍺←⊢ ⋄ ⍺ (⍺⍺{⍺←⊢ ⋄ ⍺ ⍺⍺ ⍵}⍣⍵⍵) ⍵}`.

# Example
```apl
      PowOp←{⍺←⊢ ⋄ ⍺ (⍺⍺{⍺←⊢ ⋄ ⍺ ⍺⍺ ⍵}⍣⍵⍵) ⍵}
      tnum←!PowOp-&1 ⍝ using naked ⍣ will freeze APL

      ⎕tkill tnum
```
