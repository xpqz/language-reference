Classic Edition:  the symbol `⍤` is not available in Classic Edition, and the Atop operator is instead represented by `⎕U2364`.

`f` can be any monadic function.  `Y` can be any array that is suitable as the right argument to function `g` with the result of `g` being appropriate to function `f`.

If `X` is omitted, `g` must be a monadic function. If `X` is specified, `g` must be a dyadic function and `X` can be any array that is suitable as the left argument to function `g`.

The derived function is equivalent to `fgY` or `fXgY` and need not return a result.

The Atop operator allows functions to be *glued* together to build up more complex functions.

# Examples:
```apl

      -⍤÷ 4      ⍝ (  f⍤g y) ≡  f   g y
¯0.25
      12 -⍤÷ 4   ⍝ (x f⍤g y) ≡ (f x g y)
¯3
      3 1 4 1 5 ~⍤∊ 1 2 3
0 0 1 0 1

```
