`f` must be a dyadic function. `X` must be a simple scalar or one-item integer array. `Y` may be any array whose sub-arrays along the `K`th axis are appropriate to function `f`.

The axis specification is optional. If present, `K` must identify an axis of `Y`. If absent, the last axis of `Y` is implied. The form `R←Xf⌿Y` implies the first axis of `Y`.

`R` is an array formed by applying function `f` between items of sub-vectors of length `X` taken from vectors along the `K`th (or implied) axis of `Y`.

`X` can be thought of as the width of a "window" which moves along vectors drawn from the `K`th axis of `Y`.

If `X` is zero, the result is a `(⍴Y)+(-⍴⍴Y)↑1` array of identity elements for the function `f`. See ["Identity Elements" on page 1](/reduce.md#IdentityElements).

If `X` is negative, each sub-vector is reversed before being reduced.
