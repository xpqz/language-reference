`X` and `Y` may be any arrays.  `R` is a simple Boolean array the same shape as Y which identifies occurrences of `X` within `Y`.

If the rank of `X` is smaller than the rank of `Y`, `X` is treated as if it were the same rank with leading axes of size 1.  For example a vector is treated as a 1-row matrix.

If the rank of `X` is larger than the rank of `Y`, no occurrences of `X` are found in `Y`.

`⎕CT` and `⎕DCT` are implicit arguments of Find.
