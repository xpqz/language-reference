`X` and `Y` may be any numbers except that if `Y` is a negative integer then `X` must be an integer. `R` is numeric. An element of `R` is integer if corresponding elements of `X` and `Y` are integers.

Binomial is defined in terms of the function Factorial:
```apl
      X!Y ←→ (!Y)÷(!X)×!Y-X
```

Results are derived smoothly from the Beta function:
```apl
      Beta(X,Y) ←→ ÷Y×(X-1)!X+Y-1
```

For positive integer arguments, `R` is the number of selections of `X` things from `Y` things.

# Example
```apl
      1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2!5
5 6.105689248 7.219424686 8.281104786 9.227916704 10
