`Y` may be any array.  `X` must be a simple integer array.  The axis specification is optional.  If present, `K` must be a simple integer scalar or one-element vector.

The value of `K` must be an axis of `Y`.  If absent, the last axis of `Y` is implied.  The form `R←X⊖Y` implies the first axis.

`X` must have the same shape as `Y`, excluding `Y`'s `K`th axis. Otherwise, if `X` is a one-element array, it will be extended to conform.

`R` is an array with the same shape as `Y`, with the elements of each of the vectors along the `K`th axis of `Y` rotated by the value of the corresponding element of `X`.  If the value is positive, the rotation is in the sense of right to left.  If the value is negative, the rotation is in the sense of left to right.
