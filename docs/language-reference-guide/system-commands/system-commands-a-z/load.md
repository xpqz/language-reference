  <div class="name">Load Workspace</div>
  <div class="command">)LOAD {ws}</div>
</div>

This command causes the named stored workspace to be loaded.  The current active workspace is lost.

`ws` specifies a file name. If no file extension is given, it is implied. See WSEXT configuration parameter[WSEXT on page 1](//userguide/installation-and-configuration/configuration-parameters/wsext.md#WSEXT).

If `ws` is a full or relative pathname, only the specified directory is examined.  If not, the APL workspace path (WSPATH) is traversed in search of the named workspace.  A stored workspace is one which has previously been saved with the system command `)SAVE` or the system function `⎕SAVE`.  Under Windows, if `ws` is omitted, the File Open dialog box is displayed.

If the workspace name is not valid or does not exist or if access to the workspace is not authorised, the system reports `ws not found`.  If the workspace name identifies a file or directory that is not a workspace, the system reports  `wsname is not a ws`.  If successfully loaded, the system reports workspace name `saved`, followed by the date and time when the workspace was last saved.  If the workspace is too large to be loaded into the APL session, the system reports `ws too large`.  After loading the workspace, the current namespace is set to `#` and the latent expression (`⎕LX`) is executed unless APL was invoked with the -x option. If the workspace was saved with a suspension, typing the expression `→1+⎕lc` will resume execution and switch back into the namespace associated with the suspended function.

If the workspace contains any GUI objects whose `Visible` property is 1, these objects will be displayed.  If the workspace contains a non-empty `⎕SM` but does not contain an SM GUI object, the form defined by `⎕SM` will be displayed in a window on the screen.

Holding the Ctrl key down while entering a `)LOAD` command or selecting a workspace from the session file menu causes the incoming latent expression to be *traced.*

Holding the Shift key down while selecting a workspace from the session file menu will *prevent* execution of the latent expression.
