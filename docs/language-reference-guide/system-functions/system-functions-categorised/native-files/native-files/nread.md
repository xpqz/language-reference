</div>

This monadic function reads data from a native file. `Y` is a 3- or 4-element integer vector whose elements are as follows:

| `[1]` | negative tie number, |
| --- | --- |
| `[2]` | conversion code (see below), |
| `[3]` | count. If this value is `¯1` , all of the elements defined by `Y[2]` are read from the position specified by `Y[4]` to the end of the file. This may result in the last few bytes in the file being ignored if they do not form a complete element. |
| `[4]` | start byte, counting from 0. If this value omitted or is `¯1` , data is read starting from the current position in the file (initially `0` ). |

# Notes:

`8 ⎕NINFO ⊃Y` can be used to report the current position of the file pointer.

`Y[2]` specifies conversion to an APL internal form as follows. Note that the internal formats for character arrays differ between the Unicode and Classic Editions.

If both `Y[3]` and `Y[4]` have the value `¯1`, then `⎕NREAD` reads data from the current position in the file to the end of the file.

`⎕NREAD` can be used with any file. However, calling `⎕NREAD` with at least one of `Y[3 4]` set to `¯1` is intended for regular files only; using on pipes, FIFOs or other special types of file is not recommended.

Unicode Edition: Conversion Codes

| Value | Number of bytes read | Result Type | Result shape |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 11 | count | 1 bit Boolean | 8 `×` count |
| 80 | count | 8 bits character | count |
| 82 Conversion code 82 is permitted in the Unicode Edition for compatibility and causes 1-byte data on file to be *translated* (according to `⎕NXLATE`) from `⎕AV` indices into normal (Unicode) characters of type 80, 160 or 320. | count | 8 bits character | count |
| 83 | count | 8 bits integer | count |
| 160 | 2 `×` count | 16-bits character | count |
| 163 | 2 `×` count | 16 bits integer | count |
| 320 | 4 `×` count | 32-bits character | count |
| 323 | 4 `×` count | 32 bits integer | count |
| 645 | 8 `×` count | 64 bits floating | count |

Classic Edition: Conversion Codes

| Value | Number of bytes read | Result Type | Result shape |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 11 | count | 1 bit Boolean | 8 `×` count |
| 82 | count | 8 bits character | count |
| 83 | count | 8 bits integer | count |
| 163 | 2 `×` count | 16 bits integer | count |
| 323 | 4 `×` count | 32 bits integer | count |
| 645 | 8 `×` count | 64 bits floating | count |

Note that types 80, 160 and 320 and 83 and 163 are exclusive to Dyalog APL.

# Example
```apl

      DATA←⎕NREAD ¯1 160 (0.5×⎕NSIZE ¯1) 0 ⍝ Unicode
      DATA←⎕NREAD ¯1 82 (⎕NSIZE ¯1) 0      ⍝ Classic
      DATA←⎕NREAD ¯1 82 ¯1 0       ⍝ Shorter version

```
