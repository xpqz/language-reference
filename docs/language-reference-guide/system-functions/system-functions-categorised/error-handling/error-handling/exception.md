This is a system object that identifies the most recent *Exception* thrown by a Microsoft .NET object.

`⎕EXCEPTION` derives from the Microsoft .NET class System.Exception. Among its properties are the following, all of which are strings:

| `Source` | The name of the .NET namespace in which the exception was generated |
| --- | --- |
| `StackTrace` | The calling stack |
| `Message` | The error message |

```apl
      ⎕USING←'System'
      DT←⎕NEW DateTime (100000 0 0)
EXCEPTION: Year, Month, and Day parameters describe an un-representable DateTime.
      DT←⎕NEW DateTime(100000 0 0)
     ∧
      ⎕EN
90
```
```apl
      ⎕EXCEPTION.Message
Year, Month, and Day parameters describe an un-representable DateTime.

      ⎕EXCEPTION.Source
mscorlib

      ⎕EXCEPTION.StackTrace
   at System.DateTime.DateToTicks(Int32 year,
                                  Int32 month, Int32 day)

   at System.DateTime..ctor(Int32 year,
                            Int32 month, Int32 day)
```

Similarly to GUI objects, `⎕EXCEPTION` is not preserved across a save/load cycle if the workspace is loaded in a different interpreter.
