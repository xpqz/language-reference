`Y`must be a simple character scalar or vector. `X` is optional.  If present, `X` must be a simple character scalar or vector.  `R` is a nested vector of length two whose first item is a simple logical vector and whose second item is a simple numeric vector of the same length as the first item of `R`.

`Y` is the character representation of a series of numeric constants.  If `X` is omitted, adjacent numeric strings are separated by one or more blanks.  Leading and trailing blanks and separating blanks in excess of one are redundant and ignored.  If `X` is present, `X` specifies one or more alternative separating characters.  Blanks in leading and trailing positions in `Y` and between numeric strings separated also by the character(s) in `X` are redundant and ignored.  Leading, trailing and adjacent occurrences of the character(s) in `X` are not redundant.  The character 0 is implied in `Y` before a leading character, after a trailing character, and between each adjacent pair of characters specified by `X`.

The length of the items of `R` is the same as the number of identifiable strings (or implied strings) in `Y` separated by blank or the value of `X`.  An element of the first item of `R` is 1 where the corresponding string in `Y` is a valid numeric representation, or 0 otherwise.  An element of the second item of `R` is the numeric value of the corresponding string in `Y` if it is a valid numeric representation, or 0 otherwise.
