`⎕SM` is a system variable that defines a character-based user interface (as opposed to a graphical user interface).  In versions of Dyalog APL that support asynchronous terminals, `⎕SM` defines a form that is displayed on the USER SCREEN.  The implementation of `⎕SM` in "window" environments is compatible with these versions.  In Dyalog APL/X, `⎕SM` occupies its own separate window on the display, but is otherwise equivalent.  In versions of Dyalog APL with GUI support, `⎕SM` either occupies its own separate window (as in Dyalog APL/X) or, if it exists, uses the window assigned to the SM object.  This allows `⎕SM` to be used in a GUI application in conjunction with other GUI components.

`⎕SM` has workspace scope.

In general `⎕SM` is a nested matrix containing between 3 and 13 columns.  Each row of `⎕SM` represents a field; each column a field attribute.

The columns have the following meanings:

| Column | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Field Contents | N/A |
| 2 | Field Position - Top Row | N/A |
| 3 | Field Position - Left Column | N/A |
| 4 | Window Size - Rows | 0 |
| 5 | Window Size - Columns | 0 |
| 6 | Field Type | 0 |
| 7 | Behaviour | 0 |
| 8 | Video Attributes | 0 |
| 9 | Active Video Attributes | `¯` 1 |
| 10 | Home Element - Row | 1 |
| 11 | Home Element - Column | 1 |
| 12 | Scrolling Group - Vertical | 0 |
| 13 | Scrolling Group - Horizontal | 0 |

With the exception of columns 1 and 8, all elements in `⎕SM` are integer scalar values.

Elements in column 1 (Field Contents) may be:

- A numeric scalar
- A numeric vector
- A 1-column numeric matrix
- A character scalar
- A character vector
- A character matrix (rank 2)
- A nested matrix defining a sub-form whose structure and contents must conform to that defined for `⎕SM` as a whole.  This definition is recursive.  Note however that a sub-form must be a matrix - a vector is not allowed.

Elements in column 8 (Video Attributes) may be:

- An integer scalar that specifies the appearance of the entire field.
- An integer array of the same shape as the field contents.  Each element specifies the appearance of the corresponding element in the field contents.

# Screen Management (Async Terminals)

Dyalog APL for UNIX systems on tty devices (async terminals or on terminal emulators) manages two screens; the SESSION screen and the USER screen.  If the SESSION screen is current, an assignment to `⎕SM` causes the display to switch to the USER screen and show the form defined by `⎕SM`.

Note that the RIDE does not directly support `⎕SM`, although it is possible to display `⎕SM` in the tty session to which a RIDE client is connected.

If the USER screen is current, any change in the value of `⎕SM` is immediately reflected by a corresponding change in the appearance of the display.  However, an assignment to `⎕SM` that leaves its value unchanged has no effect.

Dyalog APL automatically switches to the SESSION screen for default output, if it enters immediate input mode (6-space prompt), or through use of `⎕` or `⍞`.  This means that typing
```apl
      ⎕SM ← expression
```

in the APL session will cause the screen to switch first to the USER screen, display the form defined by `⎕SM`, and then switch back to the SESSION screen to issue the 6-space prompt.  This normally happens so quickly that all the user sees is a flash on the screen.To retain the USER screen in view it is necessary to issue a call to `⎕SR` or for APL to continue processing. e.g.

```apl
      ⎕SM ← expression  ⋄  ⎕SR 1
```

or
```apl
      ⎕SM ← expression  ⋄  ⎕DL 5
```

# Screen Management (Window Versions)

In Dyalog APL/X, and optionally in Dyalog APL/W, `⎕SM` is displayed in a separate USER WINDOW on the screen.  In an end-user application this may be the only Dyalog APL window.  However, during development, there will be a SESSION window, and perhaps EDIT and TRACE windows too.

The USER Window will only accept input during execution of `⎕SR`.  It is otherwise "output-only".  Furthermore, during the execution of `⎕SR` it is the only active window, and the SESSION, EDIT and TRACE Windows will not respond to user input.

# Screen Management (GUI Versions)

In versions of Dyalog APL that provide GUI support, there is a special SM object that defines the position and size of the window to be associated with `⎕SM`.  This allows character-mode applications developed for previous versions of Dyalog APL to be migrated to and integrated with GUI environments without the need for a total re-write.

# Effect of Localisation

Like all system variables (with the exception of `⎕TRAP`) `⎕SM` is subject to "pass-through localisation".  This means that a localised `⎕SM` assumes its value from the calling environment.  The localisation of `⎕SM` does not, of itself therefore, affect the appearance of the display.  However, reassignment of a localised `⎕SM` causes the new form to overlay rather than replace whatever forms are defined further down the stack.  The localisation of `⎕SM` thus provides a simple method of defining pop-up forms, help messages, etc.

The user may edit the form defined by `⎕SM` using the system function `⎕SR`.  Under the control of `⎕SR` the user may change the following elements in `⎕SM` which may afterwards be referenced to obtain the new values.

| Column 1 | Field Contents |
| --- | --- |
| Column 10 | Home Element - Row (by scrolling vertically) |
| Column 11 | Home Element - Column (by scrolling horizontally) |
