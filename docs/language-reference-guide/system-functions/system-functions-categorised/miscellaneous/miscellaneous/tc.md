`⎕TC` is a deprecated feature and is replaced by `⎕UCS` (see note).

`⎕TC` is a simple three element vector.  If `⎕ML<3` this is ordered as follows:

| `⎕TC[1]` | Backspace |
| --- | --- |
| `⎕TC[2]` | Linefeed |
| `⎕TC[3]` | Newline |

Note that `⎕TC≡⎕AV[1+⍳3]` for `⎕ML<3` .

If `⎕ML≥3`the order of the elements of `⎕TC` is instead compatible with IBM's APL2:

| `⎕TC[1]` | Backspace |
| --- | --- |
| `⎕TC[2]` | Newline |
| `⎕TC[3]` | Linefeed |

Elements of `⎕TC` beyond 3 are not defined but are reserved.

# Note

With the introduction of `⎕UCS` in Version 12.0, the use of `⎕TC` is discouraged and it is strongly recommended that you generate control characters using `⎕UCS` instead. This recommendation holds true even if you continue to use the Classic Edition.

| Control Character | Old | New |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Backspace | `⎕TC[1]` | `⎕UCS 8` |
| Linefeed | `⎕TC[2] (⎕ML<3) ⎕TC[3] (⎕ML≥3)` | `⎕UCS 10` |
| Newline | `⎕TC[3] (⎕ML<3) ⎕TC[2] (⎕ML≥3)` | `⎕UCS 13` |
