`Y` must be a simple numeric scalar or vector containing one or more of the values for name-class.  See also ["Name Classification: " on page 1](/nc.md#NameClassification).

`X` is optional. If present, it must be a simple character scalar or vector. `R` is a list of the names of active objects whose name-class is included in `Y` in standard sorted order.

If *any* element of `Y` is negative, positive values in `Y` are treated as if they were negative, and R is a vector of character vectors. Otherwise, `R` is simple character matrix.

Furthermore, if `⎕NL` is being evaluated inside the namespace associated with a Class or an Instance of a Class, and any element of `Y` is negative, `R` includes the Public names exposed by the Base Class (if any) and all other Classes in the Class hierarchy.

If `X` is supplied, `R` contains only those names which begin with any character of `X`. Standard sorted order is in Unicode point order for Unicode editions, and in the collation order of `⎕AV` for Classic editions.

If an element of `Y` is an integer, the names of all of the corresponding sub-name-classes are included in `R`. For example, if `Y` contains the value 2, the names of all variables (name-class 2.1), fields (2.2), properties (2.3) and external or shared variables (2.6) are obtained. Otherwise, only the names of members of the corresponding sub-name-class are obtained.

# Examples:
```apl

      ⎕NL 2 3

FIND
FOO

      'AV' ⎕NL 2 3

`⎕NL` can also be used to explore Dyalog GUI Objects, .NET types and COM objects.

## Dyalog GUI Objects

`⎕NL` may be used to obtain lists of the Methods, Properties and Events provided by Dyalog APL GUI Objects.
```apl

      'F' ⎕WC 'Form'
      F.⎕NL -2 ⍝ Properties
 Accelerator AcceptFiles  Active  AlphaBlend  AutoConf  Border  BCol  Caption ...

      F.⎕NL -3 ⍝ Methods
 Animate  ChooseFont  Detach  GetFocus  GetTextSize  ShowSIP  Wait

      F.⎕NL -8 ⍝ Events
Close  Create  DragDrop  Configure  ContextMenu  DropFiles  DropObjects  Expose  Help ...
```

## .NET Classes (Types)

`⎕NL` can be used to explore .NET types.

When a reference is made to an undefined name, and `⎕USING` is set, APL attempts to load the Type from the appropriate .NET Assemblies. If successful, the name is entered into the symbol table with name-class 9.6.
```apl

      ⎕USING←'System'
      DateTime
(System.DateTime)
      ⎕NL -9
 DateTime
      ⎕NC,⊂'DateTime'
9.6
```

The names of the Properties and Methods of a .NET Type may then be obtained using `⎕NL`.
```apl

      DateTime.⎕NL -2 ⍝ Properties
 MaxValue  MinValue  Now  Today  UtcNow 

      DateTime.⎕NL -3 ⍝ Methods
 get_Now  get_Today  get_UtcNow  op_Addition  op_Equality  ...
```

In fact it is not necessary to make a separate reference first, because the expression `Type.⎕NL` (where `Type` is a .NET Type) is itself a reference to Type. So, (with `⎕USING` still set to `'System'`):
```apl

      Array.⎕NL -3
 BinarySearch  Clear  Copy  CreateInstance  IndexOf  LastIndexOf  Reverse  Sort

      ⎕NL -9
 Array  DateTime
```

Another use for `⎕NL` is to examine .NET *enumerations*. For example:
```apl

      ⎕USING←'System.Windows.Forms,system.windows.forms.dll'

      FormBorderStyle.⎕NL -2
Fixed3D  FixedDialog  FixedSingle  FixedToolWindow  None  Sizable  SizableToolWindow 

      FormBorderStyle.FixedDialog.value__
3

      FormBorderStyle.({⍵,[1.5]⍎¨⍵,¨⊂'.value__'}⎕NL -2)
 Fixed3D            2
 FixedDialog        3
 FixedSingle        1
 FixedToolWindow    5
 None               0
 Sizable            4
 SizableToolWindow  6
```

## COM Objects

Once a reference to a COM object has been obtained, `⎕NL` may be used to obtain lists of its Methods, Properties and Events.
```apl

      xl←⎕NEW'OLEClient'(⊂'ClassName' 'Excel.Application')

      xl.⎕NL -2 ⍝ Properties
 _Default  ActiveCell  ActiveChart  ActiveDialog  ActiveMenuBar  ActivePrinter  ActiveSheet  ActiveWindow ...

      xl.⎕NL -3 ⍝ Methods
 _Evaluate  _FindFile  _Run2  _Wait  _WSFunction  ActivateMicrosoftApp  AddChartAutoFormat  AddCustomList  Browse  Calculate ...

      ⎕NL -9
 xl
```
