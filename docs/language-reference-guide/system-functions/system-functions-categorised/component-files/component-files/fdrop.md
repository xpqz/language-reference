`Y` must be a simple integer vector of length 2 or 3 whose elements are:

| `[1]` | a file tie number |
| --- | --- |
| `[2]` | a number specifying the position and number of components to be dropped.  A positive value indicates that components are to be removed from the beginning of the file; a negative value indicates that components are to be removed from the end of the file |
| `[3]` | an optional passnumber which if omitted is assumed to be zero |

The shy result of a `⎕FDROP` is a vector of the numbers of the dropped components. This is analogous to `⎕FAPPEND` in that the result is potentially useful for updating some sort of dictionary:
```apl
      cnos,←vec ⎕FAPPEND¨tie ⍝ Append index to dictionary
      
      cnos~←⎕FDROP tie,-⍴vec ⍝ Remove index from dict.
```

Note that the result vector, though potentially large, is generated only on request.

# Examples
```apl
      ⎕FSIZE 1
1 21 5436 4294967295
 
      ⎕FDROP 1 3 ⋄ ⎕FSIZE 1
4 21 5436 4294967295
 
      ⎕FDROP 1 ¯2 ⋄ ⎕FSIZE 1
4 19 5436 4294967295
 
```
