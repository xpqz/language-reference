`Y` can be a simple character scalar, vector or matrix, or a vector of character vectors representing the names of 0 or more defined functions or operators. Used dyadically, this function closely emulates the APL2 implementation. Used monadically, it returns information that is more appropriate for Dyalog APL.

`Y` specifies one or more names. If `Y` specifies a single name as a character scalar, a character vector, or as a scalar enclosed character vector, the result `R` is a vector. If `Y` specifies one or more names as a character matrix or as a vector of character vectors `R` is a matrix with one row per name in `Y`.

# Monadic Use

If `X` is omitted, `R` is a 4-element vector or a 4 column matrix with the same number of rows as names in `Y` containing the following attribute information:

`R[1]` or `R[;1]`: Each item is a 3-element integer vector representing the function header syntax:

| 1 | Function result | 0 if the function has no result 1 if the function has an explicit result `¯1` if the function has a shy result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | Function valence | 0 if the object is a niladic function or not a function 1 if the object is a monadic function 2 if the object is a dyadic function `¯2` if the object is an ambivalent 				function |
| 3 | Operator valence | 0 if the object is not an operator 1 if the object is a monadic operator 2 if the object is a dyadic operator |

The following values correspond to the syntax shown alongside:
```apl

        0  0  0     ∇ FOO
        1  0  0     ∇ Z←FOO
       ¯1  0  0     ∇ {Z}←FOO
        0 ¯2  0     ∇ {A} FOO B
       ¯1  1  2     ∇ {Z}←(F OP G)B
```

`R[2]` or `R[;2]`: Each item is the (`⎕TS` form) timestamp of the time the function was last fixed.

`R[3]` or `R[;3]`: Each item is an integer reporting the current `⎕LOCK` state of the function:

| `0` | Not locked |
| --- | --- |
| `1` | Cannot display function |
| `2` | Cannot suspend function |
| `3` | Cannot display or suspend |

`R[4]` or `R[;4]`: Each item is a character vector - the network ID of the user who last fixed (edited) the function.

# Example
```apl

    ∇ {z}←{l}(fn myop)r
[1]   ...

    ∇ z←foo
[1]   ...

    ∇ z←{larg}util rarg
[1]   ...

      ⎕LOCK'foo'

      util2←util
```
```apl

      ]display ⎕AT 'myop' 'foo' 'util' 'util2'

# Dyadic Use

The dyadic form of `⎕AT` emulates APL2. It returns the same rank and shape result containing information that matches the APL2 implementation as closely as possible.

The number of elements or columns in `R` and their meaning depends upon the value of `X` which may be 1, 2, 3 or 4.

If `X` is 1, `R` specifies *valences* and contains 3 elements (or columns) whose meaning is as follows:

| 1 | Explicit result | 1 if the object has an explicit result or is a variable 0 otherwise |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | Function valence | 0 if the object is a niladic function or not a function 1 if the object is a monadic function 2 if the object is an ambivalent function |
| 3 | Operator valence | 0 if the object is not an operator 1 if the object is a monadic operator 2 if the object is a dyadic operator |

If `X` is 2, `R` specifies *fix times* (the time the object was last updated) for functions and operators named in `Y`. The time is reported as 7 integer elements (or columns) whose meaning is as follows. The fix time reported for names in `Y` which are not defined functions or operators is 0.

| 1 | Year |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Month |
| 3 | Day |
| 4 | Hour |
| 5 | Minute |
| 6 | Second |
| 7 | Milliseconds (this is always reported as 0) |

If `X` is 3, `R` specifies *execution properties* and contains 4 elements (or columns) whose meaning is as follows:

| 1 | Displayable | 0 if the object is displayable 1 if the object is not displayable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | Suspendable | 0 if execution will suspend in the object 1 if execution will not suspend in the object |
| 3 | Weak Interrupt behaviour | 0 if the object responds to interrupt 1 if the object ignores interrupt |
| 4 |  | (always 0) |

If `X` is 4, `R` specifies *object size* and contains 2 elements (or columns) which both report the `⎕SIZE` of the object.
