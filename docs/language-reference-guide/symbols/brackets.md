# Round Parentheses

Round brackets or parentheses are used in [APL expressions](/introduction/expressions.md#) to control the order of execution.  They are also used in function/operator headers to indicate [Namelists](/defined-functions-and-operators/tradfns/namelists.md#).  A right parenthesis is also used to introduce a [System Command](/system-commands/introduction.md#).

# Square Brackets

Square brackets have three distinct meanings in Dyalog APL. They are used to select sub-arrays from an n-dimensional array and to indicate an axis along which a function (operand) is to apply. See [Bracket Indexing](/primitive-functions/indexing.md#) and [Bracket Axis Operator](/primitive-operators/operators-summarised.md#). A right bracket is also used to introduce a [User Command](//userguide/the-apl-environment/user-commands.md#).

# Curly Brackets

Curly brackets have three distinct meanings in Dyalog APL. They are used to indicate shy results and optional left arguments in defined functions. They are also used to enclose the definition of a dfn and a dop. See [Model Syntax](/defined-functions-and-operators/tradfns/model-syntax.md#) and [Dfns & Dops](/defined-functions-and-operators/dynamicfunctions/dynamic-functions-and-operators.md#).
